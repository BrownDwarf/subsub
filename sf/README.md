`sf`- Starfish files

You'll need to define an environment variable `$subsub` which is the path to the subsub repository.  

For example, on my laptop I define:

```bash
export subsub="/Users/gully/GitHub/subsub/"
```

But it'll have to be different for TACC.

You'll also need to activate the right conda environment:

`conda env list`

My environment is py3.4, so:

`source activate py3.4`
