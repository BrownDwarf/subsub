These directories contain imaging data of S1063.

The 2MASS images were retrieved on the [IRSA web portal](https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/2MASS/IM/interactive.html) on 1/23/2019 by querying the source `Cl* NGC 2682 SAND 1063` with a 60 arcsecond subimage size.

The PanSTARRS-1 images were downloaded from [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/), with a query for the same object as above.
