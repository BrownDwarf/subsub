# Outline

- **Introduction**
	- [ ] What is a sub-subgiant?
	- [ ] What causes sub sub giant stars (Leiner et al. 2017)
	- [ ] M67 S1063
		- [ ] Prototypical subsub (Geller et al. 2017)
		- [ ] Binary orbit, SB1
	- [ ] Starspots as confounding factors
		- [ ] Inhibit convective efficiency (redder and bigger)
		- [ ] Also confound observations: assign incorrect Teff
		- [ ] This paper aims to measure the starspot coverage and temp
	- [ ] Layout of this paper
- **Observations and data reduction**
	- [x] IGRINS observations
	- [x] Ground-based photometric monitoring- ASASSN, AAVSO, ASAS
	- [x] K2 data Campaigns 5, 16, 18 Superstamps and detrending
	- [x] Zero points with FFIs or super stamps
	- [ ] *stretch goal* APOGEE?
	- [x] Gaia data (membership confirmed)
- **Analysis**
	- [ ] Summary and assumptions of our methods
	- [ ] K2 data
		- [ ] Interpreting lightcurves
		- [ ] Period and amplitude of lightcurve
			- [ ] Multi-term Lomb-Scargle + Celerite Fourier reconstruction
	- [ ] Archival V-band photometry (ASASSN+)
	- [ ] IGRINS two-temperature spectral inference w/ Starfish
		- [x] MCMC convergence and posterior predictive checks
		- [x] `figure:` IGRINS Spectra
		- [ ] Internal consistency of vsini, v_z
	- [ ] Limits on companion contribution
		- [ ] Via Near-IR flux contribution from binary companion
		- [ ] Via Velocity-based
- **Results**
	- [ ] We detect spots in spectra
		- [x] S1063 has ~X% coverage fraction of spots with T_spot ~ Y based on IGRINS + Starfish
		- [x] *bonus* Revised effective temperature using both temperature components [f_spot * T_spot^4 + (1 -f_spot) * T_ambient^4] = Teff^4
		- [ ] *bonus* Rsini
	- [x] IGRINS observations occurred at flux loss of X% of global maximum, max spot coverage of Y occurred in year 2012
	- [x] `figure:` T_spot versus f_spot plot
	- [x] What coverage fraction would we have measured across the rotational phase?
- **Discussion**
	- [ ] Spot coverage is consistent with formation theories
	- [ ] Conceivable geometries with circumpolar active longitudes, or migrating active latitudes
	- [ ] Biases introduced if we assume a spot-free model
		- [ ] Where does subsub sit in a new HR diagram? (new Somers models)
		- [ ] *bonus* `figure:` PMS HR diagram with new Somers tracks
		- [ ] Spot impact on SED fits
- **Appendix**
	- [ ] TBD
